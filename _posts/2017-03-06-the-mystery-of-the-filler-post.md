It doesn't matter if we are talking about the dreams we have when we sleep, or about our goals, or things that we want, that we metaphorically call dreams. We all have quite a few.

Let's talk about the night-time dreams first. Scientists have quite a few theories of what dreams really are, and why we have them. It's your choice what you believe. I think that every night, we create a separate universe in our minds, in which we may, or may not return another night. They can be nasty, undecipherable, even nightmarish. We may or may not remember them, believe them, hope for them to become true, and sometimes they end up happening in real life, like some sort of prophecy. Some we want to share, others not.

But the other dreams, the life goals... They are something else. Although they are in our imagination too, most of the times they are real things, that can happen, and we want them to unlike nightmares. Some people say *die with memories, not dreams* but I think that's not possible. Even at an advanced age, when you achieved most of your dreams you still have something to fight for. A dream that keeps you alive. I am sure some of you are dreaming about having certain things, or getting to certain places, making memories and friends, but me... I only dream that I can be happy one day, that I could finally find myself, and get out from the darkness where I am today, as you will find out soon enough why.

My advice to you is to always set up goals in your lives, dream crazy things, that for some may sound unreachable, because those things will keep you getting through bad days.

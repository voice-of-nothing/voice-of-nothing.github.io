A very discussed and controversial subject amongst psychologists, often seen as a moral flaw, akin to vanity and selfishness, later described as "love of self" or "regard for one's own happiness or advantage" as Wikipedia says. However, in my opinion, self love is something that you are not born with, rather a capacity you develop and improve over time.

Many kids, teenagers and also grownups tend to lack the capacity of loving themselves. This is very sad to say, but true. Why does this happen, you ask?
First, I will have to add a disclaimer. I am not a psychologist, sociologist, or anybody with any knowledge of professional medical care. I only write things from my point of view.

Getting back to the subject, our society, the kids nowadays are dealing with bullies from kindergarten. When kids get home and tell their parents that somebody told them that their head is big, parents only laugh and say nothing. Then the kid grows up believing his/her head is big. The solution is simple, you may think. Tell the kids not to listen to the bully. But that means the person will return the other day, and say something else, and keep going until he will be stopped. But when it stops, will the bullied kid still be the same? The answer is no. And that is how he/she will not develop self-love. So many people say "Love yourself. You are perfect the way you are. Don't ever let anybody get you down!" , but is it really just that simple?

My advice for you is to start with small steps. Take a pen and write down every day one thing you love about yourself, physically or mentally. If you've done that, and you feel it's not working write down one thing you hate about yourself every day for a week. Then the next week try working on those things. For example, if you hate your hair, go to a hairdresser, and ask for some advice, make it look the way you like it. If it worked, cross it out. And keep doing that until the list is empty. I did this when I felt I hated myself, and it worked. I hope it will work for you as well.

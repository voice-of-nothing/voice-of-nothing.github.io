Greetings, readers. As you might have noticed we haven't really posted anything lately. Except for [Discover](https://discover.voxnihi.li), a project started by<!--more--> our very own [Vahid](http://www.frvl.me) we haven't been actively doing *anything*. Even _Discover_ had to be delayed (probably until January) but don't fret. There'll be posts coming soon, after we're not being overwhelmed with assignments and school projects.

Also, Waldemar has officially left the team. We wish him luck with his future endevours!

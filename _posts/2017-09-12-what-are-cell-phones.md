You know those really edgy and "deep" posts on Facebook (or any other social platform, for that matter) that change the meaning of words or phrases that describe something to a metaphorical or literal meaning, often intended to make it funnier or darker, depending on the situation?

Look, I get why you'd make this type of shit and in this context I completely agree with what the message is, but it still infuriates me how **some people unironically believe this is the actual meaning of the word cell phone**. When I find stuff like this, I take my time and explain what the phrase/word actually means in that context, usually without success. I'm not judging anyone for posting things like this. I'm judging people who believe word-by-word what the post is saying, even if the person who uploaded it didn't. That is why, for once I'd like to explain shortly what "cell" stands for.

__A cellular phone__ is what essentially every phone in the world is, ranging all the way from the old flip phones to your overpriced, underachieving iPhone. Major exceptions include landline and satellite phones which use different techniques of connecting you to the person you are contacting. Back in 1979 a man called V.H. MacDonald published an article by the name of *The Cellular concept* for _The Bell System Technical Journal_. He proposed a system for creating wireless phones which would involve building antennas at certain distances from one another, so the caller would not be grounded at a specific spot and could move freely over great distances without having to interrupt the call he was making. Since then the concept has become reality, and is used worldwide.

There you have it. That's it. That's the reason they are called cellphones. And yes, even your flagship smartphone uses the same 70s technique of making calls. Feels premium, doesn't it?

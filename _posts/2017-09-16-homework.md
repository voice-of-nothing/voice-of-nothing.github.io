For many of us the day we become 7 years old is also the day we are condemned to attend school. Maybe you didn't get homework the first year, but you definitely did during second grade. And why? How does doing homework improve your knowledge?<!--more-->

Let me just say this. **My opinion** is that homework doesn't improve your grasp of a certain subject considerably. Now that we got that out of the way, let's actually start this Shallow Dive.

_Homework, or a homework assignment, is a set of tasks assigned to students by their teachers to be completed outside the class. Common homework assignments may include a quantity or period of reading to be performed, writing or typing to be completed, math problems to be solved, material to be reviewed before a test, or other skills to be practiced._

Wikipedia is wonderful. Back to the point though, there were many studies conducted on the effect of homework on children and their academic performance. These studies were mostly inconclusive, as the majority only focused on their performance in standardized tests (these are a whole other level of bullshit, I'll leave it for some other time). For starters people who defend the ideology of homework usually bring the following arguments to the table:

* It improves children's thinking and memory
* It teaches children to work independently
* It encourages children to explore subjects more fully
* It helps children to get ready for the next dayâ€™s class
* It helps children integrate learning by applying many different skills to a single task, such as book reports or science projects

These are valid points which are true in some situations but they are not applicable to every student. This is something that really bothers me, how we have tried to apply the same label, same principle, same techniques to everybody. I see this being done over and over in places such as schools or hospitals.

Every child, every human is different, psychologically and physically alike. **We need to dismember the idea that one universal scale can measure every single human being** (just rotated back to the standardized testing, haven't I?). 

Anyway, back in the 2000s, there was [some research](http://unihomework.wikispaces.com/file/view/Relationship_Homework_Achievement.pdf) done on the effectiveness of homework and its effects on academic performance. The research showed that students in elementary school (1-4) had no improvements in academic performance over the students who didn't have any homework, sometimes their results would be worse. In middle school (5-8) results varied, although the consensus was that their performance was generally better, compared to the group that didn't have any sort of homework. In high school students (9-12) the results clearly showed a direct correlation between homework and academic performance. Students who had completed their homework had much better results than those who hadn't.

It is important to note that middle school students who spent over 60-80 minutes and high school students who spent over 2 hours on their homework assignments every day had a poorer performance compared to those who spent less time on homework, in some cases even worse than the students who hadn't completed any assignments at all. Also, think about how the students who get overwhelmed with homework perceive school. Think about their psychological development.

In my opinion __children in elementary school (1-4) should get NO homework, while students in middle school (5-8) and high school (9-12) should get reasonable amounts of homework.__

Children in elementary school do not yet have the self-control to dedicate so much of their time to solving homework, I would rather recommend giving them assignments that involve them discovering their surroundings and interacting with the world around them. Middle school and high school students should get assignments that should take between 30-60 minutes and 1-2 hours to complete, while at the same time there should be offered counseling for students with stress issues related to completing homework because as I said already, not every human being is the same. This is my recommendation for schools.

P.S.
*Teachers, please do not get triggered by this post. I know some of you also have a similar view of the situation, and as for the minister of education, just be glad that I didn't even mention other countries and how their educational system abolished homework entirely, also shortening the number of days per year students spend in school, the results being a skyrocketing in their academic performance.*

So, you have finally arrived here. What is *Vox Nihili*? The phrase itself means _The Voice of Nothing_. In this context it signifies just how small and insignificant we can be in this indifferent universe. <!--more-->

Just how lost we can be in a sea filled with a million other voices, all screaming, trying to get heard. It could also mean that what you read here is just something else in the immense ocean of writings.

But if you stop and listen to that voice, you may discover incredible things or just simply be [mildly interested](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/) by the contents of this blog. And maybe this way, it means that it is merely Vox Nihili while no one is listening. And if you choose to listen, you will discover content such as (but not limited to) stories both fictional and non-fictional, life lessons, memoirs, opinions, all brought to you by 3 individuals who decided to team up because we are *Fortior Concordia*,stronger united.

If you decided that it's worthwhile to listen, stick around.

P.S.
_Memoirs is a real word, google it. xD_

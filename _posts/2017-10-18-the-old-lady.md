I pass this old lady every day. I see her standing on the stairs of a corner building here in Cluj. She is selling flowers so she can live. I haven't ever seen somebody really buying her flowers until today. I stopped at the street light and looked in her direction.
I saw a younger lady, in her twenties maybe, talking to her. She bent down and really talked to the old lady. This made me wonder. Is our society really paying attention to the old lady? And if not, do we pay attention to each other? What is the difference between us and her? She needs to stay there all day in order to live, but few people even care. At that moment I really wished to be somebody else, somebody more understanding, somebody who cares.

I wouldn't even think about going to buy flowers from her, even less to talk to her. My thoughts started flying, she is trying to do something. She does not stay home and wait for the money to somehow fly to her like so many nowadays. She is **there** during summer and winter, under the burning sun and cold rain, and nobody cares. I have some friends like that, whom I try to talk with but never pay attention to me, unless they need something, of course.

So few people think about others. Nobody really cares about what is happening with the lonely kid in the hallways, always with his earphones plugged in, who never really talks to others. Or with the smart girl in the class who is always learning, reading or doing homework she was given the class before. Nobody cares what is up with the kid everybody hates because he is trying to fight everybody. Nobody ever asks the depressed youth why is he pretending to be cutting his wrists in every break. Do you? 
But does the old lady ever been asked why is she there? Where her family is? I don't think so.

I am not telling you to ask the old lady anything, I am not telling you to give her money. I am asking you to pay attention to the people nobody ever talks to. To the ones you see that look sad, to the ones you see and are angry or mad and even to the ones you haven't noticed before. Yes, you really should stop being selfish and do so.
